==== Building OpenSim ====

=== Building on Windows ===

Steps:
 * runprebuild.bat
 * Load OpenSim.sln into Visual Studio .NET and build the solution.
 * chdir bin 
 * copy OpenSim.ini.example to OpenSim.ini and other appropriate files in bin/config-include
 * run OpenSim.exe

=== Building on Linux ===

Prereqs:
 * Mono >= 2.4.3
 * Nant >= 0.85
 * On some Linux distributions you may need to install additional packages.  
    See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Dependencies for more information.

 * May also use xbuild (included in mono distributions)
 * May use Monodevelop, a cross-platform IDE 

From the distribution type:
 * ./runprebuild.sh
 * nant (or xbuild)
 * cd bin 
 * copy OpenSim.ini.example to OpenSim.ini and other appropriate files in bin/config-include
 * run mono OpenSim.exe

=== Using Monodevelop ===

From the distribution type:
 * ./runprebuild.sh
 * type monodevelop OpenSim.sln
